# mongodb-tenant-proxy

A MongoDB wire-protocol proxy that confines every client connection to **one tenant's documents** in shared collections. Applications keep using their normal driver and queries; the proxy rewrites each command so it can only read, write, count, aggregate or index documents whose `tenantId` equals the connection's tenant.

```
app (driver) ──► mongodb-tenant-proxy ──► MongoDB (replica set / standalone)
                 • identifies the tenant
                 • rewrites every command
                 • allow-list of commands/stages
```

## How isolation is enforced

| Operation | Rewrite |
|---|---|
| `find`, `count`, `distinct`, `delete`, `update`/`findAndModify` filters | `{$and: [{tenantId: T}, <original>]}` – a client `$or`/`$nor`/`tenantId` clause can never widen it |
| `insert`, replacement updates, upserts | `tenantId` stamped on every document; a different value is **rejected** |
| update operators | any operator touching `tenantId` (`$set`, `$unset`, `$rename`, `tenantId.x`…) is rejected; pipeline updates get a final `$set: {tenantId: T}` |
| `aggregate` | tenant `$match` injected first (merged into a leading `$match` so `$text` still works; `$geoNear.query` scoped); `$lookup`, `$graphLookup`, `$unionWith` (incl. nested and `$facet` branches) are scoped on the foreign side |
| `createIndexes` | keys prefixed with `tenantId`, so unique indexes are **per tenant** and every query uses the index; `listIndexes` hides the prefix |
| `drop` | becomes "delete this tenant's documents" |
| `getMore` / `killCursors` | only cursors opened on the same connection are usable |
| `listDatabases` | filtered to accessible databases |
| `explain` | inner command is rewritten |
| `$changeStream` | opt-in, collection-level only – see below |

Everything else is **denied** by default: `$out`, `$merge`, `$currentOp`, `$collStats`, `$indexStats`, `$search`, `$documents`, `dropDatabase`, `renameCollection`, `collMod`, `mapReduce`, views, `system.*` collections, `admin`/`local`/`config`, server-side JavaScript (`$where`, `$function`, `$accumulator` unless `allowJS`), duplicate command keys, and unknown commands. Denials are returned as `Unauthorized (13)` and logged.

## Identifying the tenant (`auth.mode`)

* **`scram`** – clients connect with `mongodb://user:pass@proxy/?authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256`; each user is bound to a tenant in the config. Generate entries with `MTP_PASSWORD=… mongodb-tenant-proxy hash-password -user acme -tenant acme`.
* **`appname`** – tenant = the driver's `appName`. With `appNameSecret` set the name must be `<tenant>.<hmac>` (`mongodb-tenant-proxy sign-appname -secret … -tenant acme`); without it, the proxy must only be reachable by trusted services.
* **`static`** – every connection belongs to `staticTenant` (one proxy/port per tenant, e.g. behind per-tenant network policy).

The proxy authenticates to MongoDB itself (SCRAM-SHA-256, optional TLS) and presents itself to drivers as a `mongos`, so drivers never discover and bypass it via replica-set member addresses.

## Change streams

Enable with `"changeStreams": {"enabled": true, "autoEnableImages": true}` (MongoDB 6.0+). Delete and update events don't contain the tenant field, so the proxy forces `fullDocument`/`fullDocumentBeforeChange: "required"` (collection pre/post images), puts a `$match` on those images directly after `$changeStream` (before any client stage), and strips the images again unless the client asked for them. A tenant therefore only ever receives its own events, with no per-event lookups and no proxy-side state. `autoEnableImages` lets the proxy run `collMod` with its own credentials the first time a collection is watched; otherwise enable `changeStreamPreAndPostImages` yourself.

Trade-offs: pre/post images add oplog/storage cost on watched collections; filtering is server-side, so each open stream still scans the shared oplog (cost grows with watchers). Database- and cluster-level streams are refused, and drop/rename/invalidate events are not delivered to tenants.

## Run

```bash
go build -o mongodb-tenant-proxy ./cmd/mongodb-tenant-proxy
./mongodb-tenant-proxy serve -config proxy.json
```

See [`proxy.example.json`](proxy.example.json). Metrics (`/metrics`, Prometheus text) and `/healthz` are served on `metricsAddr`. Client-facing TLS: `clientTLS.certFile/keyFile`.

## Performance

* Raw BSON rewriting – no struct decoding. A `find` rewrite is ≈0.85 µs / 33 allocs; stamping a 1,000-document insert is ≈125 µs.
* One goroutine and one dedicated upstream connection per client connection (cursors, sessions and transactions keep native semantics). Unmodified replies are forwarded as raw bytes.
* Measured on a laptop over loopback: point `findOne` ≈24 µs through the proxy vs ≈16 µs direct.

## Requirements and limitations

* MongoDB **5.0+** (uses `$lookup` with both `localField` and `pipeline`). Transactions and retryable writes need a replica-set upstream, like with any driver.
* `_id` is unique per *collection*, not per tenant. Use generated ObjectIds/UUIDs; a natural `_id` reused by two tenants will collide (and reveals existence).
* Indexes are shared physical objects: one tenant creating an index affects all; `dropIndexes: "*"` is refused. Deny `createIndexes`/`dropIndexes` via `denyCommands` if tenants must not manage indexes. TTL indexes cannot carry the tenant prefix (unique TTL indexes are refused).
* The `tenantId` field is visible in returned documents.
* No wire compression (not advertised), no `SCRAM-SHA-1`/x.509 on the client side.
* Session ids (`lsid`) are unguessable UUIDs but are not bound to a tenant.

## Tests

```bash
go test ./internal/...            # rewriter unit tests
go test ./test/ -count=1          # integration: real mongod replica set + official Go driver
go test ./test/ -bench FindOne -run xxx
```
Integration tests start their own `mongod` (must be on `PATH`) and cover isolation for CRUD, aggregation stages, cursors, bulk writes, transactions, indexes, and all three auth modes including an auth-enabled upstream.
